### AI Engineering | RAG & LLM Systems

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong background in large-scale enterprise systems and automation, currently working with Python at TRT6.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science and a postgraduate degree in Data Science (CIn/UFPE). Over the past months, I have been focusing on **applied AI Engineering**, with emphasis on:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM-based applications
- Agentic workflows
- End-to-end AI and ML pipelines

My work combines solid software engineering practices with modern data-driven and LLM-based architectures, focusing on reproducibility, modular design, and real-world applicability.
